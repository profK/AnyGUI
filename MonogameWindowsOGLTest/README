This folder contains the AnyGUI demo and test for Windows OpenGL.

It is based on Monogame for Windows OpenGL which has a potential dependency on 
the OpenAL library.  If you get an error that your system cannot find openal.dll then
run the OpenAL installer "oalinst.exe" in the sub-directory named "Third Party".

To run the demo, double click on MonogameWindowsOGLTest.exe
